# React-Dashboard

## Description

<!-- In this project I taught myself how to use redux following [this](https://codeburst.io/learn-how-to-build-astronomy-picture-of-the-day-app-with-nasa-api-and-react-redux-e462ef0c806c) tutorial. To drive home the idea of redux I created a UserContainer and UserCard to understand just what redux is doing. I used the NASA API to pull images and data and display it to the user. I also setup a timer that poles the nasa api every minute and a half to pull new images. If you would like additional information about the image scroll down, other wise you can leave this up on a monitor and look at images of space all day.  -->
